## ✨ Using MustafaGPT (AI Assistant)

The portfolio includes an interactive AI assistant, MustafaGPT. To enable its full capabilities, you need to configure an OpenAI API key:

1.  **Obtain an OpenAI API Key:**
    *   If you don't have one, sign up at [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/signup) and create an API key.

2.  **Set up Environment Variable:**
    *   In the root directory of the project, create a file named `.env.local`.
    *   Add your OpenAI API key to this file as follows:
        ```env
        VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_actual_openai_api_key_here
        ```
    *   Replace `your_actual_openai_api_key_here` with your real API key.
    *   The `.env.local` file is already listed in `.gitignore`, so your API key will not be committed to the repository.

3.  **Start the Application:**
    *   If the application is already running, restart it for the environment variable to take effect.
    *   Run `npm run dev` (or your usual command to start the development server).

If the API key is not provided or is invalid, MustafaGPT will display an error message, and its responses will be limited.
